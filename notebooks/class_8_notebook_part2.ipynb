The bill, titled the Secure and Inclusive Immigration Act, proposes a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in the United States.\n",

Additionally, the bill includes provisions to enhance border security and modernize the legal immigration system to better meet the needs of the economy.\n",

      "Several advocacy groups and immigration experts have lauded the bill as a long-overdue step towards a more just and humane immigration policy. However, the bill's fate remains uncertain as it faces an uphill battle in Congress, where partisan divisions on immigration policy have long stymied progress.\n",

Critics, on the other hand, argue that the bill is too lenient on enforcement and fails to adequately address the root causes of illegal immigration.\n",
