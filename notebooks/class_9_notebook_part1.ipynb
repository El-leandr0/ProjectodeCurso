**Building a Simple Chatbot**:\n","   - We will write a Python script that interacts with the OpenAI API to generate responses based on user input.\n","   - We will discuss how to structure prompts to get desired responses and the importance of fine-tuning them for optimal results.\n","\n","2. **Tracking Token Consumption**:\n","   - We will delve into how OpenAI counts tokens and why it’s important to monitor token usage during interactions.\n","   - We will implement a method to keep track of token consumption, which is crucial for managing costs and understanding input/output limits.\n","\n","3. **Using the Moderation API**:\n","   - We will explore OpenAI's Moderation API to detect and filter inappropriate content.\n","   - We will discuss best practices for integrating content filtering into our chatbot to ensure it adheres to safety guidelines.\n","\n","4. **End-to-End Chatbot System**:\n","   - Finally, we will put it all together by creating an end-to-end system that integrates user interaction, API calls, token tracking, and content moderation.\n","   - We will emphasize the importance of testing and iterating on the chatbot to improve its performance over time."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import
